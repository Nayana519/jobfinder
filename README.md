### Project Description
[Our project is a local job-finding platform designed to connect job seekers with full-time and part-time opportunities in nearby businesses. It allows employers to post job openings through an easy-to-use dashboard and enables job seekers to search, filter, and apply for jobs seamlessly. The platform focuses on fostering community connections and simplifying local¬†recruitment]

### The Problem statement
[The ridiculous problem we are solving is the persistent issue of local unemployment caused by the lack of accessible platforms connecting job seekers with nearby opportunities. Small businesses struggle to find the right talent, while job seekers often overlook openings in their vicinity. Our project bridges this gap, reducing unemployment by streamlining local job discovery and¬†recruitment]

### The Solution
[Our project solves local unemployment by making job hunting and hiring ridiculously easy. Job seekers can quickly find full-time or part-time opportunities right around the corner, while local businesses get a simple way to post openings and connect with the right people. It‚Äôs all about cutting out the frustration and helping our community thrive. By focusing on local connections, we‚Äôre bringing jobs closer to home and making the hiring process feel less like a chore. Together, we‚Äôre building a platform that works for everyone, one¬†job¬†at¬†a¬†time.]
